## Overview

The CITA Node Operator provides an easy and solid solution to deploy and manage a full CITA-Cloud blockchain service stack to the target [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) clusters in a scalable and high-available way. The CITA Node Operator defines multiple custom resources on top of Kubernetes [Custom Resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/). The Kubernetes API can then be used in a declarative way to manage CITA-Cloud deployment stack and ensure its scalability and high-availability operation.
